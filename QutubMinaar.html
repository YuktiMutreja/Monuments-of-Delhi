        <p><strong>Qutab Minar is a soaring, 73 m-high tower of victory, built in 1193 by Qutab-ud-din Aibak 
            immediately after the defeat of Delhi's last Hindu kingdom.</strong> 
        </p>
            
    <p><strong>The tower has five distinct storeys, each marked by a projecting balcony and tapers from a 
             15 m diameter at the base to just 2.5 m at the top.</strong>  
            </p>    
             
     <p><strong>The first three storeys are made of red sandstone; the fourth and fifth storeys are of 
            marble and sandstone. At the foot of the tower is the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, the first
            mosque to be built in India. An inscription over its eastern gate provocatively 
             informs that it was built with material obtained from demolishing '27 Hindu temples'. 
           </strong>
         </p>

     <p><strong>A 7 m-high iron pillar stands in the courtyard of the mosque. It is said that if you can 
                 encircle it with your hands while standing with your back to it your wish will be 
                 fulfilled.
                </strong>
