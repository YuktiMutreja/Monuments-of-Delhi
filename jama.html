    <p><strong> Jama Masjid is derived from the word 'Jummah', referring to the congregational prayer
         observed by Muslims on Fridays. Built from red sandstone and white marble, is considered the
          largest mosque in India. Each year, on Eid, thousands of reverent Muslims throng the mosque to 
          offer special Eid Namaz in the morning. </strong>
    </p>

    <p> <strong>The domes are in turn capped with gold adornments. Two lofty minarets, standing 40 m high,
         decorated in longitudinal stripes of white marble and red sandstone, flank the domes on either side.
          Each minaret has 130 steps inside and only the southern one is open to public for a fee.
