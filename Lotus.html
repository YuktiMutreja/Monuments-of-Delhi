    <p><strong> The temple is built in the shape of a lotus flower amidst the lush green landscape that 
        turn up to a pleasant and tranquil ambience. It is a Bahai House of Worship and is open to people 
        from all religions. The Baha√≠ Faith is a world religion whose purpose is to unite all races and
